            <h3>Potential Negative Effects</h3>
            <p class="negative-effects">There have been numerous studies on the ill effects on disorganizations and
                excess clutter can
                have on a persons mental health ranging from increased stress, anxiety and procrastination to
                implications for your physical health and personal relationships.
            </p>
            <p class="negative-effects">Having an organized space is beneficial not only to your physical and mental
                wellbeing but also in
                regards to storing your important possessions such as keys, jewellery, or important letters. An
                optimized living space can help assign certain artefacts to specific locations so you know where
                they are when you need them and are not late to any important meetings or appointments because you
                cannot find what you are looking for.
