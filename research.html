            <p>Previous research shows that a cluttered or even a disorganised environment can not only have negative
                effects to your mental health such as depression, anxiety, and shame but can also impact your physical
                health with an increased risk of excess dust, mould or allergens which is especially dangerous for those
                with asthma.</p>
